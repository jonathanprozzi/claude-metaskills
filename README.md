# Claude Metaskills

**Metaskills** are skills that help create other skills. They solve the knowledge elicitation problem — helping domain experts discover and structure what they know for Claude Code.

## The Problem

Most people who want to create a Claude Code skill face two problems:

1. **They don't know the format** — What's a SKILL.md? What's the frontmatter?
2. **They don't know the decisions** — Should this be a skill or a command? Do I need reference files? What structure fits my knowledge?

Template-based tools solve problem #1. **Metaskills solve problem #2.**

## What's Included

### `/skill-builder` — The Core Metaskill

Interviews you about your expertise, identifies patterns, recommends skill vs command, and generates the artifact.

```
You → Run /skill-builder
     → Answer questions about your expertise
     → Get a generated skill or command
```

**Features:**
- Conversational interview flow (not form-filling)
- Refinement branch — collaborate on improvements before packaging
- Skill vs command recommendation based on your knowledge shape
- Detection-based destination (respects your dotfiles workflow)

### Examples

Commands and skills generated using `/skill-builder`:

| Example | Type | What It Does |
|---------|------|--------------|
| `/create-prd` | Command | Interview → structured PRD with fidelity detection |

## Installation

```bash
# Copy to your commands directory
cp commands/skill-builder.md ~/.claude/commands/

# Or symlink for easy updates
ln -s $(pwd)/commands/skill-builder.md ~/.claude/commands/skill-builder.md
```

## Usage

```bash
# In any Claude Code session
/skill-builder
```

Then answer the interview questions. The metaskill will:
1. Understand your expertise
2. Offer suggestions (if you want them)
3. Recommend skill vs command
4. Generate the artifact
5. Save to your preferred location

### For Teams

The skill-builder works well for capturing expertise from non-technical team members:

```
Domain expert runs /skill-builder
       │
       ▼
Answers interview questions
       │
       ▼
Chooses "Show me the raw files"
       │
       ▼
Technical teammate adds to team repo
```

The metaskill handles **capture**. A technical curator handles **distribution**. This keeps the process accessible while maintaining quality.

## Methodology

The metaskills approach is **tool-agnostic**. The patterns work across platforms:

- **Two-problem frame** — format vs decisions
- **Refinement branch** — capture vs collaborate vs suggest
- **Fidelity detection** — adapt depth to input
- **Skill vs command logic** — based on knowledge shape signals

Claude Code is the current implementation. The methodology ports to other AI coding tools.

## Validation

This approach is validated by how experienced Claude Code users already work. [Thariq (@trq212)](https://x.com/trq212/status/1873065033869750299), an Anthropic employee, shared a similar spec-based interview workflow (696K+ views).

The difference: his approach is ad-hoc prompting. Metaskills package the pattern so anyone can access it.

## Development Philosophy

**This repo is a human-Claude collaboration.** These metaskills emerge from ongoing pair work between [@jonathanprozzi](https://github.com/jonathanprozzi) and Claude — not prompts written in isolation, but patterns discovered through actual collaborative sessions.

**We dogfood everything.** Every metaskill here has been:

1. Built and tested in personal dotfiles first
2. Used in real work sessions (not just demos)
3. Iterated based on actual friction points
4. Graduated to this repo only when solid

This isn't a collection of ideas — it's a collection of patterns we actually use together.

- [docs/methodology.md](docs/methodology.md) — collaboration philosophy behind these tools
- [docs/skills-vs-commands.md](docs/skills-vs-commands.md) — decision guide for choosing extension types

## Roadmap

**Shipped:**
- `/skill-builder` — Interview → generate skills or commands

**Planned** (dogfooding in dotfiles first):
- `/hook-builder` — Interview → generate hooks + config

**Examples** (generated BY skill-builder):
- `/create-prd` — Interview → structured PRD with fidelity detection

### The Translation Insight

Metaskills are **translation layers** — they help others adopt patterns we've refined through collaboration:

| Metaskill | Input | Output |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| `/skill-builder` | "I have expertise" | Packaged skill or command |
| `/hook-builder` | "I want X to happen when Y" | Working hook + config |

Each demystifies a different Claude Code extension point.

### What's NOT in this repo

Commands like `/problem-frame`, `/decision-doc`, `/retrospective` use the same methodology but don't create Claude Code extension points — they create documents. Those belong in [claude-utils](https://github.com/jonathanprozzi/claude-utils).
